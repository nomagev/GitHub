# Tips by Nala Gnirut

This is just a simple experiment to play with Git and Github.

I will be uploading little text snips and similar things into this repository.

Feel free to clone it and to check it out.

If you have nice tips and tools, do not hesitate to contact me through GitHub [https:www.github.com/nomagev](https://github.com/nomagev)

Also, please keep in mind the whole repository is under GPL v.2 license (sharing is caring).

Have a great one!
