# Windows 10 Tricks

The following are a set of practical tips to use on Windows 10.

**IMPORTANT:** I am doing this repository of things for myself. If you plan to use some of it, make sure you know what you are doing and, to be clear, you will be doing so under your own discretion.

The idea is to compile all useful things I do on Windows 10 not to forget about them.

## Tip 1 - Windows 10 God Mode (also works on Windows 7)

There is a way to trigger Windows 10 "God Mode" (a menu, "Control Panel" like, where you will have all the available options to use on Windows, Operating System wise.

To do so:

1. Create a new, empty folder in the Desktop.
2. Rename folder name to: `GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}`
3. Enjoy it and be careful.
